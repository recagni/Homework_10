<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

<!-- The purpose of this program is to generate a web page that looks like the "Landing" page in the homework instructions.

  <head>

    <!-- META TAG
    The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. 
    Although not displayed on the page, metadata are machine parsable. 
    Meta elements are typically used to specify the page description, keywords, author, last modified, and other metadata.
    The "charset" attribute of the <meta> tab specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. -->

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    
    <!-- The "name" attribute of the <meta> tag defines a description, keywords, and the author of an HTML document. 
    It also defines the viewport to control the page's dimensions and scaling for different devices. -->

    <meta name="description" content="Data Science Bootcamp Project">
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML,CSS,JavaScript">
    <meta name="author" content="Matteo Recagni">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <!-- The "X-UA-Compatible" value assigned to the "http-equiv" attribute of the <meta> tag allows web authors to choose the 
    version of Internet Explorer to be used to render the page.
    By giving to the "content" attribute the value "ie-edge" we tell Internet Explorer to display content in the highest mode 
    available (e.g., for Internet Explorer 9, IE9 is the highest mode available). 
    Not using this line of code may result in not being able to render the page if the user is using some older version of the
    browser. -->

    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">

    <!-- TITLE TAG
    Bootstrp is a very popular open-source toolkit for developing in HTML, CSS, and JS.
    The <title> tag captures the label that appears in the page tag, at the top of screen. -->

    <title>Bootstrap Visualization Dashboard</title>

    <!-- SHEET STYLE ATTRIBUTE OF THE LINK TAG
    The <link> tag defines a link between a document and an external resource and is used to link to external style sheets.
    The "rel" attribute of the <link> tag is used to define the relationship ("rel") between the linked file and the HTML document. 
    While rel="stylesheet" specifies a persistent or preferred style (i.e., one that is always applied when style sheets are enabled),
    rel="alternate stylesheet" defines an alternate style. 
    The remaining attributes of the tag specify where to find the stylesheet ("href", in this case, the folder assets/css) and the 
    "media" used (in this case, a screen). -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/bootstrap.min.css" media="screen">

    <!-- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) describes how HTML elements are going to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media, and can 
    control the layout of multiple pages all at once.
    In this case, we are adding CSS to our HTML elements internally, meaning by using a "style" element in the "head" section of our 
    file.  CSS could have also be added by using the "inline" method (using the style attribute in HTML elements) or the "external" 
    method (using an external CSS file). -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/styles.css" media="screen">

  </head>

  <!-- BODY -->

  <body>

    <!-- NAVIGATION BAR
    A navigation bar is a navigation header that is placed at the top of the page.
    With Bootstrap, a navigation bar can extend or collapse, depending on the screen size.
    A classic navigation bar (colored text on white background) can be added with the next lines of code, which start with the <nav> 
    tag and continue with various <div> tags (container units that encapsulate other page elements and divide the HTML document into 
    different sections).
    The "container-fluid" value assigned to the aatribute "class" of the <div> tag creates a full width container, spanning the entire
    width of your viewport. -->

    <nav class="navbar navbar-default">
      <div class="container-fluid navbar-custom">
        <div class="navbar-header">

          <!-- The "type" attribute of the <button> tag specifies the type of button among the following ones: (a) "button": classic 
          clickable button; (b) "submit": submits form-data; (c) "reset": resets the form-data to its initial values).
          In this case, we are using the classic button.
          The class "navbar-toggle collapsed" specifies that we are using a collapsable navigation bar, meaning that it could be 
          displayed only when the button is clicked. -->

            <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1" 
              aria-expanded="false">

              <!-- The <span> tag is used to group inline-elements in a document and provides no visual change by itself.  Rather, it 
              provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document.
              When a text is hooked in a <span> element, you can style it with CSS, or manipulate it with JavaScript. 
              Assigning the "sr-only" value to the "class" attribute of the <span> tag makes it readable for screen readers (e.g., 
              blind people). -->

              <span class="sr-only">Toggle Navigation</span>

              <!-- The "icon-bar" value of the "class" attribute of the <span> tag creates an icon bar (i.e., a bar containing various 
              icons) with CSS. -->

              <span class="icon-bar"></span>

            </button>

            <!-- The "col" element of the "class" attribute of the <div> tag defines the column size.
            The Bootstrap grid system has four classes: xs (phones), sm (tablets), md (desktops), and lg (larger desktops). 
            Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same widths for phones and tablets, you only need to specify the phone 
            ("xs").
            The screen is divided in 12 parts.  So, for instance, the commented out code below creates three columns, with the central 
            one twice as large as the external ones.

              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-3">.col-sm-3</div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">.col-sm-6</div>
                <div class="col-sm-3">.col-sm-3</div>
              </div> 
            
            In our case, since in the navigation bar we just want to place the small "Lattitude" a width equal to 1/12 of the screen
            wouls work.  On the page, one can always check the apparence on the various screen by first showing the page code (right
            click on the page and then select "Insect") and then toggling between the two top bar leftmost icons. -->

            <div class="col-xs-1 phone-nav">
              <a class="navbar-brand" href="#" id="logo">Lattitude</a>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- We now gather all the navigation links, forms, and the other content for toggling. -->

          <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="bs-example-navbar-collapse-1">

            <!-- The <ul> tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list, as opposed to the <ol> tag, which creates a ordered one (i.e.,
            starting with numbers instead of bullets). -->
            
            <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">  

              <!-- The <li> tag defines a list item. 
              The element "dropdown" of the <li> tag defines a dropdown menu containing the four main metheorogical characteristics,
              found in the folder "visualizations". -->

    <!-- CONTAINER 
    Bootstrap imposes that rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment
    and padding. This is the area where we place the main text of the site, as specified in the homework instructions' "landing-lg" 
    page. 
    Below, the "section" and "article" tags could equivalently be substited by generic <div> tags, except that their presence improve
    readibility, in that they show the reader in which part of the page we are. -->

    <div class="container">

            largest text that stands out.

            <hr class="description-hr"/>

            <!-- The <img> tag defines an image in an HTML page and has two required attributes: "src" and "alt".
            Images are not technically inserted into an HTML page, but rather linked to the page. The <img> tag creates a holding
            space for the referenced image. 
            The "src" attribute of the <img> tag contains the URL where the image is hosted.
            The "alt" attribute of the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for the image.  Since in this case the homework
            example doesn't show any alternative text, we can omit this attribute.
            The optional "id" attribute specifies a unique id for this image. -->

            <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this 
              analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.</p>
            <p>After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we 
              looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and 
              visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and
